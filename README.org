* Description
This is a tiny set of _portable_ bindings to `popen`, `pclose`, and `fileno`.
This project exists because nothing I found on Hackage or in `base` allowed me
to work with C pipes and raw file descriptors portably across Posix and Windows.
Everything I found in the `base` seemed to require dealing with either `Handle`s
or importing `System.Posix` which does not work on Windows.
* Installation
Simply doing `stack install` should work.
* Demo
To help you get started this project ships with an executable `hs-open-exe`
which simply lists the files in the current directory.
